                JavaScript Basics</h1>
                
            
           
           
            
                <p><a href="#">JavaScript</a> JavaScript: is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language
                    allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to
                    the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <p>• <a href="#">JavaScript</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a
                    cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                    variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
                    Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                    have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a
                    value to a variable. var x = 10;
                <p>• <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables
                    you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean
                    true or false; null null aka nothing; Number 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array [1,
                    'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'} Conditionals When you
                    write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code
                    blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your
                    code to accomplish this. </p>
                <p>There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our
                    code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we
                    execute this block of code; </p>
                <p>• <a href="#">Loops</a>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
                    but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine
                    you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </p>
                <p>• <a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function
                    this will run that code block. Thỉnk of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
                    putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw
                    the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and
                    over again.</p>
